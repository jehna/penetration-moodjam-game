## Credits

Game by Jesse Luoto. Made with [CreateJS][createjs] at
[Mood - The Jam Kouvola vol. 1][gamejam]. Game made fully in 48 hours.

Mood Jam was an experimental game jam where you pick a song, and try to create a
game around that song, trying to achieve the exact mood of the track presented
in the game. So it would be a sort of a music video for the chosen track.

This game is based on the song Penetration by Iggy and the Stooges.
